# momo-iis

momo-iis : a basic cookbook for building an ASP.net core, MVC-style app server.

ASP.net application goes in the files/default/momo-iis directory, or customize to suit your build. Use of the remote_directory here is a bit
of a hack meant to reflect real-world best practices; in a more robust use case it is best to store your application outside of the cookbook.

This was made by a Widnows-inept Linux engineer to help a friend learn ASP/C# development, and is the roughest of approaches. :ihavenoideawhatimdoing:
