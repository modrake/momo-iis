# momo-iis

momo-iis : a basic cookbook for building an ASP.net server.

ASP.net application goes in the files/default/momo-iis directory, or customize to suit your build. Use of the remote_directory here is a bit
of a hack meant to reflect real-world best practices; in a more robust use case it is best to store your application outside of the cookbook.
